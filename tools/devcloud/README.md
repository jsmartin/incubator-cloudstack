NOTE - This folder is a work in progress.  The project has not determined
how to best establish a nightly DevCloud build process, or how to distribute

# How to use devcloud

Install RVM with the latest ruby 1.9.3 patch set (not documented)


cd deps

	cd deps/
	#cleans up any old stuff
	./boxer.sh -c all
	#builds the dependent vms
	./boxer.sh -b all


After that is complete

	#go back to the devcloud homedir
	cd ../
	#bring up the devcloud vm
	vagrant up

If you get a vagrant error, at that point, try:

	source .rvmrc
	vagrant up
	
It will now bring up the devcloud vm for this first time.  Note that it will attempt to download the SSVM and CPVM templates so it will take a long time to launch initially.  It will also git clone the cloudstack repository and attempt to build an launch it. 

You can optionally speed things up by packaging a successful devcloud instance build.  This will make subsequent launches must faster since it won't have to re-downoad the SSVM and CPVM.  Once it has successfully been built, you can run:

    #exports the devcloud vagrant instance and adds it as "devcloud" to vagrant boxlist
	./boxit.sh
	#modifies the Vagrant file to use this newly added instance
  	sed -i 's,devcloudbase-xen,devcloud,g' Vagrantfile
